## Usage and Requirements

This repository contains two main elements: firmware source code and tooling.

Firmware is built through the included eCTF Tools. These tools invoke the Makefiles
in specific ways in the provided Nix environment. Firmware compiling should be executed 
through these included tools.

Source code and tooling is provided that runs directly on the host. All of these tools are 
created in Python. The tools can be easily installed with the use of Poetry. Once inside 
of the activated Nix environment, run `poetry install` to initialize the Poetry environment. 
These tools can be invoked either through `poetry run {toolname}` or by activating the poetry environment
with `poetry shell` and then running as standard python programs.

### Environment Build

The environment is built with a Nix, which should install all packages
necessary for running the design in a reproducible fashion. The environment is automatically 
built when an eCTF Build Tool is run. If building `analog_openocd.nix` this step may 
take some time to complete.

Development can be prototyped by launching into the Nix environment through `nix-shell`.

### Host Tools

Host Tools for the 2024 competition do not need to be modified by teams at any point. Your design
should work with the standardized interface between host and MISC system. The host tools will 
pass any required arguments to the MISC system and receive all relevant output.

### Deployment

When creating a deployment, the Makefile within the `deployment` folder of the design 
repo will be executed. This is the only stage in which information can be shared between 
separate portions of the build (e.g. components and application processors). A clean 
target should be implemented in this Makefile to allow for elimination of all generated secrets.

### Application Processor and Component

When building the application processor and components, the `Makefile` with the 
respective directories will be invoked. The eCTF Tools will populate parameters into 
a C header file `ectf_params.h` within the design directory. Examples of these header 
files can be found in the respective main source files for the application processor 
and component.

## Using the eCTF Tools
### Building the deployment 
This will run the `Makefile` found in the deployment folder using the following inputs:

```

## Flashing
Flashing the MAX78000 is done through the eCTF Bootloader. You will need to initially flash the eCTF Bootloader onto the provided hardware. 
This can be done easily by dragging and dropping the [provided bootloader](https://ectfmitre.gitlab.io/ectf-website/2024/components/bootloader.html) (for design phase:`insecure.bin`) to the DAPLink interface. DAPLink will show up as an external drive when connected to your system. Succesfull installation would make a blue LED flash on the board.

To flash a specific bootloader image on the board (AP or Components), use `ectf_update`.
```
ectf_update [-h] --infile INFILE --port PORT

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --infile INFILE  Path to the input binary
  --port PORT      Serial port
```

**Example Utilization**
```bash
ectf_update --infile example_fw/build/firmware.img --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```
