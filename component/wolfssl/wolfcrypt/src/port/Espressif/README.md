### Building

Simply run `ESP-IDF.py` in any of the [Espressif/ESP-IDF/Examples](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/tree/master/IDE/Espressif/ESP-IDF/examples).
See the respective project README files. Examples are also available using wolfssl as a [Managed Component](https://components.espressif.com/components/wolfssl/wolfssl).

Hardware acceleration is enabled by default. All settings should be adjusted in the respective project component
`user_settings.h` file. See the example in [template example](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/IDE/Espressif/ESP-IDF/examples/template/components/wolfssl/include/user_settings.h).
In particular, comment out the `NO_[feature_name]` macros to enable hardware encryption:

    /* #define NO_ESP32_CRYPT                 */
    /* #define NO_WOLFSSL_ESP32_CRYPT_HASH    */
    /* #define NO_WOLFSSL_ESP32_CRYPT_AES     */
    /* #define NO_WOLFSSL_ESP32_CRYPT_RSA_PRI */

To disable specific portions of the hardware acceleration you can optionally define:

```c
/* Disable all SHA, AES and RSA acceleration */
#define NO_ESP32_CRYPT

/* Disable only AES acceleration */
#define NO_WOLFSSL_ESP32_CRYPT_AES

/* Disabled only SHA acceleration */
#define NO_WOLFSSL_ESP32_CRYPT_HASH

/* Disabled only RSA Primitive acceleration */
#define NO_WOLFSSL_ESP32_CRYPT_RSA_PRI
```

See the [wolfcrypt/port/Espressif/esp32-crypt.h](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/port/Espressif/esp32-crypt.h)
for more details on fine tuning and debugging options.

### Coding

In your application you must include `<wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h>` before any other wolfSSL headers.
If building the sources directly we recommend defining `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS` (typically defined in the `CMakeLists.txt`)
and adding your own `user_settings.h` file. You can find a good reference in the [Espressif examples](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/tree/master/IDE/Espressif/ESP-IDF/examples)
as well as other examples such as [IDE/GCC-ARM/Header/user_settings.h](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/IDE/GCC-ARM/Header/user_settings.h).
